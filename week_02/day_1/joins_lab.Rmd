#1.1 read in data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

actors <- read_csv("data/actors.csv")
movies <- read_csv("data/movies.csv")
roles <- read_csv("data/roles.csv")
```

#1.2

#actors: PK = id, FK = id
#movies: PK = id, FK = id
#roles: PK = role, FK = actor_id and movie_id

#actors and roles: one to many
#movies and roles: one to many
#actors and movies: many to many

#2

```{r}
#2.1 find id of interest
current_id <- movies %>% 
  filter(name == "Little Mermaid, The") %>% 
  pull(id)

#2.2 get The Little Mermaid roles 
little_mermaid_roles <- roles %>% 
  filter(movie_id == current_id)

#2.3 get actors who appeared in The Little Mermaid using left join
left_join(little_mermaid_roles, actors, by = c("actor_id" = "id"))

#2.4 try inner join
inner_join(actors, little_mermaid_roles, by = c("id" = "actor_id"))

#results in 2.3 and 2.4 are the same because every role (left side of the join) has an associated actor
#using inner_join you can have the arguments in either order, giving the same result
```

#3

```{r}
#find actors with more than one film, then join on roles and movies

actors_more_than_once <- actors %>% 
  filter(film_count > 1) %>% 
  left_join(roles, by = c("id" = "actor_id")) %>% 
  left_join(movies, by = c("movie_id" = "id"))

#find each actor's average rating
#create a new column containing the actor's full name (to read output easily)

actors_ave_ratings <- actors_more_than_once %>%
  unite(name, first_name:last_name, sep = " ") %>% 
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarise(name = name, ave_rating = mean(as.double(rank), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  distinct()

#get top five actors - keep ties

top_five_actors <- slice_max(actors_ave_ratings, ave_rating, n = 5)

```

#4
#Find the actor who has appeared in most films. List the films they appeared in,
#the year the film was released and their role in the film.

```{r}

#find the most prolific actor and drop ties, just in case
most_films <- actors %>% 
  slice_max(film_count, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) %>%
#join on roles then movies
  left_join(roles, by = c("id" = "actor_id")) %>% 
  left_join(movies, by = c("movie_id" = "id")) %>%
#create actor_name column
  unite(act_name, first_name:last_name, sep = " ") %>% 
#select desired information
  select(act_name, name, year, role)

```
